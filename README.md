## Hi there 👋 I'm Nuki

He is someone who enjoys going deeper into data —  
especially spatial data, WebGIS systems, backend architecture, and how things work behind the map.

Currently learning and building:
- PostGIS & spatial SQL  
- WebGIS (Vue / OpenLayers)  
- Backend APIs (Node.js / FastAPI)  
- System security & scalable architecture
